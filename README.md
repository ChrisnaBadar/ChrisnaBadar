hi, i'm Chrisna Badar, a passionate self-taught full stack Android developer and a freelance Apps engineer from Indonesia. my passion for Android Apps lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with simplicity. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

i am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
